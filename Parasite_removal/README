To use hough line detection and cropping algorithm please follow these simple steps:

Step1 image :
for now the only sudokus that function are those with pure black on white,
with low disparity in line thickness.
the issues for functionality are due to the nonimplementation of a proper Otsu algorithm
and an issue with the lecture of hough space data.


Step2 launching:
to have the algorithm run simply type "make" whilst in this folder followed by "./hough_line".
check the "outp" folder for cropped and labelled cases.

Step3 Enjoy :

Enjoy your images




TO IMPROVE:

-fix reading from hough space to include thinner lines within thicker borders
-make a more reliable hough space lecture algorithm
-implement modifications to crop out lines surrounding the cases.


Completed and functional:

-Hough Line detection and board generation
-Cropping algorithm
-case saving into dedicated folder with proper labelling
